Tobnet is an advanced game plugin engine for Minecraft. Built on the Spigot API, Tobnet provides an out of the box arena based game engine with deep customization options to design your dream game. Tobnet was designed to remove the most time consuming part of creating a standalone Minecraft game plugin, the core arena functionality. The dream was an out of the box solution which allowed you to focus on designing just your gameplay, leaving the concerns of player management, displays, menus, etc. to Tobnet.
